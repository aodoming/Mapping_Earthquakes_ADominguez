# Mapping_Earthquakes_ADominguez

#### Description:
Creating insightful data visualizations with interactive maps  and features on earthquakes from around the world.


#### Project Summary:
Supporting website and mobile application development by using the latest earthquake GEOJSON 
data, will traverse and retrieve the earthquake data by using JavaScript and the D3 and Leaflet
libraries and plot the data on a mapbox map through an API request.

On your map the magnitude and location of each earthquake will be shown in a pop-up marker. The diameter of the markers for each earthquake should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitude will appear larger and darker in color with a legend providing the context for the map data.
