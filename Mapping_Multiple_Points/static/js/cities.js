// Note: When handling large datasets, it's a best practice to have the data in an external file and
// refer to that file and dataset in the logic.js file. Even though our cities array is not that large,
// letâ€™s create a new file in the "js" folder called cities.js. Cut & paste the cities array data from
// the logic.js to the cities.js file (as a way of practicing the best practice)

// An array containing each city's location, state, and population.
